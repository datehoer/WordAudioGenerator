### üí¨ Introduction

I recently found a post on v2ex introducing [English improvement techniques](https://www.v2ex.com/t/940277). Besides getting familiar with the words by sight, I believe it's also important to get familiar with them by sound. I came across New Oriental's 100 sentences for IELTS vocabulary, and decided to use ChatGPT to generate articles based on the words, then create audio files to listen to during commutes.

The feature of generating Excel files came about because I found that exporting words in List required an additional fee. So I added this feature. Initially, I planned to use a dictionary to write the meanings of the words, but later I felt it would be better to use ~~Google Translate~~ SQLite3 for queries. ~~The translation utilizes the `translate.py` file. Of course, to use Google Translate, a proper network environment is necessary~~ Query existing data, and if not found, generate using ChatGPT/Google/Youdao Translate.

### üöÄ Features
- English-Chinese Excel word list generation: Organizes words, translations, and phonetic symbols into Excel format for easy memorization and review.
- Article text and audio generation: Generates English articles based on given words and converts them to audio files (openai/pyttsx3/gTTS) for listening practice.
